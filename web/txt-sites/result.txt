a) 0.9 to 1.2 ns/km b) 0.2 to 1 ns/km c) 0.23 to 5 ns/km d) 0.45 to 8 ns/km 
Answer: b
Explanation: As all optical fiber sources have a finite spectral width, the profile shape must be altered to compensate for this dispersion mechanism. The minimum overall dispersion for graded index fiber is also limited by other intermodal dispersion mechanism. Thus pulse broadening values lie within range of 0.2 to 1 ns/km.

15. An MQW cascaded laser is more advantageous because of ___________
a) Mode hopping b) Auger recombination c) Control over layers of material d) Properties of material 
Answer: c
Explanation: In MQW cascaded layers, cascading creates number of injector/collector and active region in single stage. Each region contains a single quantum wells. Such structures permit maximum injection/collection of current and thereby produce a large number of photons. This formation of any injector/collector and active regions is achieved through precise control of several hundreds of layers of the material, where each layer should only be few nanometers thick.
